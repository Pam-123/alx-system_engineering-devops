Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project Outage
Issue Summary
Upon the deployment of the latest update to our web application, an outage occurred starting at approximately 16:30 SAST on June 20, 2024. The primary web application was inaccessible, leading to a 100% service outage for all users. The root cause was identified as a misconfigured load balancer, which caused a cascading failure across the web server cluster.

Debugging Process
Initial Detection and Verification:

16:30 SAST: Automated monitoring system triggered alerts due to a spike in HTTP 500 errors.
16:32 SAST: On-call engineer verified the issue and began investigating potential causes.
Investigation Steps:

Database Check:

16:35 SAST: Suspected database overload due to traffic surge. Checked database performance metrics but found no issues.
DDoS Attack Investigation:

16:45 SAST: Considered the possibility of a DDoS attack. Network traffic analysis showed no unusual activity.
Escalation:

17:00 SAST: Escalated to senior engineering team due to lack of progress.
Load Analysis:

17:15 SAST: Senior engineer identified unusually high load on specific web servers, suggesting a load balancer issue.
Server Restart Attempts:

17:30 SAST: Restarted web servers individually, but the issue persisted, indicating a more systemic problem.
Load Balancer Configuration Review:

17:45 SAST: Discovered misconfiguration in the load balancer that directed all traffic to a single server.
Resolution:

17:50 SAST: Corrected the load balancer configuration to distribute traffic evenly across all web servers.
18:00 SAST: Web application services were fully restored, and normal traffic resumed.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The misconfigured load balancer caused all incoming traffic to be routed to a single web server instead of being evenly distributed across the server cluster. This led to the overloaded server failing, creating a cascading effect that resulted in the entire application becoming unavailable.

Resolution:
The engineering team corrected the load balancer configuration to ensure proper traffic distribution. Once the configuration was updated, the web servers were able to handle the traffic load, and service was restored.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Load Balancer Configuration Management:
Implement a more rigorous configuration management process for load balancer settings.
Automated Testing:
Introduce automated testing for load balancer configurations to catch errors before deployment.
Enhanced Monitoring:
Set up more granular monitoring to detect uneven traffic distribution early.
Incident Response Training:
Conduct regular training sessions for the engineering team on handling load balancer-related issues.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Load Balancer Software:
Apply the latest patches to fix the known bug in the load balancer.
Add Monitoring on Load Balancer Traffic:
Implement detailed monitoring to track traffic distribution in real-time.
Review Load Balancer Configuration:
Conduct a comprehensive review of the current load balancer setup.
Automate Configuration Deployment:
Use infrastructure-as-code tools to manage and deploy load balancer configurations.
Conduct Load Balancer Failure Drills:
Simulate load balancer failures and practice response procedures regularly.
By addressing these specific areas, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure a more robust and resilient web application service.

Summation
In short, the outage was caused by a misconfigured load balancer that directed all traffic to a single server. The error was corrected by updating the load balancer configuration to distribute traffic evenly. This incident underscores the importance of rigorous configuration management, thorough testing before deployment, and enhanced monitoring to quickly detect and address issues.

Prevention measures include automated testing, improved configuration management, and regular training and drills for the engineering team. These steps will help ensure the reliability and resilience of our web application service.
